CRISPRv

CRISPRv associates CRISPR-Cas9 based public gene essentiality data with quantitative cellular phenotypes. The association is based on linear model and can be established using the code in file CRISPRv.R. In addition, a phenotype file, eg. cell_size.csv and the gene essentiality scores in file Achilles_gene_effect.csv are required.
